# Frontend Products Display Fix

## 🔍 **Issue Identified**
Products not showing on frontend after API URL change from `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **CORS Configuration** ✅
- Created `app/Http/Middleware/Cors.php`
- Added CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Registered middleware in `app/Http/Kernel.php`

### 2. **API Client Configuration** ✅
- Changed `withCredentials: false` to avoid CORS issues
- Kept absolute URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`

### 3. **Backend API Status** ✅
- API is working: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/featured`
- Returns 4 products: iPhone, Samsung, Nike, Bishop
- All products have correct data structure

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### 1. **Clear Browser Cache**
```
Ctrl + F5 (Hard refresh)
Or open in Incognito mode
```

### 2. **Check Frontend Console**
```
F12 → Console tab
Look for any CORS or network errors
```

### 3. **Test API Direct**
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/featured
Should return JSON with 4 products
```

### 4. **Test Frontend**
```
http://localhost:8082/
Should show featured products on home page
```

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

### **Home Page Should Show:**
- ✅ iPhone 15 Pro (with dummy image)
- ✅ Samsung Galaxy S24 (with dummy image)  
- ✅ Nike Air Max 270 (with dummy image)
- ✅ Bishop (with uploaded image)

### **Console Should Show:**
```
Featured products loaded: 4
Product image data: { name: "iPhone 15 Pro", primary_image: "https://dummyimage.com/...", hasImage: true }
Converting relative to absolute: /storage/products/... → http://127.0.0.1:8000/storage/products/...
```

## 🚀 **Quick Fix Commands**

### **Restart Laravel Server**
```bash
cd "d:\xamp neww\htdocs\hadri"
php artisan serve
```

### **Clear Laravel Cache**
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

### **Test API**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/featured
```

## 🔄 **If Still Not Working**

### **Check These:**
1. **Laravel server running** on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
2. **Frontend server running** on `http://localhost:8082`
3. **Browser console** for any errors
4. **Network tab** to see if API calls are being made

### **Alternative Fix:**
If CORS still causing issues, temporarily use proxy in frontend:

```javascript
// In frontend vite.config.js
export default {
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': 'http://127.0.0.1:8000'
    }
  }
}
```

Then change API base URL back to `/api`

## ✅ **Status**
CORS middleware added and API client configured. Products should now display on frontend.

**Hard refresh browser and check!** 🔄
