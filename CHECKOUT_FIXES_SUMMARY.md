# Checkout System - Issues Fixed

## Problems Resolved

**Solution**: 
- Completely rewrote `CheckoutView.vue` with proper form fields
- Added radio buttons for payment methods (COD and Stripe)
- Added proper form validation and data binding

### 2. âœ… Form Not Updated
**Issue**: Checkout form was static without proper data binding
**Solution**:

### 3. âœ… Orders Not Being Placed
**Issue**: Multiple backend issues preventing order placement
**Solutions**:

- **Session Handling**: Added web middleware to cart and checkout routes
- **Database Schema**: Added 'confirmed' status to orders table
- **Stock Management**: Implemented proper stock reduction for COD orders
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive validation and error responses

## Technical Changes Made

### Backend Fixes

1. **Routes (`routes/api.php`)**:
   ```php
   // Added web middleware for session support
   Route::middleware(['web'])->prefix('cart')->group(function () {
       // Cart routes
   });
   
   Route::middleware(['web', 'auth:sanctum'])->group(function () {
       Route::post('/checkout', [CheckoutController::class, 'store']);
   });
   ```

2. **CSRF Middleware (`app/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php`)**:
   ```php
   protected $except = [
       'api/*',  // Exclude all API routes from CSRF
   ];
   ```

3. **Database Migration**:
   - Added 'confirmed' status to orders enum
